Calculator Project

This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application consists of three main files: index.html, which structures the calculator's user interface; styles.css, which styles the layout and enhances the visual
appeal; and main.js, which contains the core functionality and logic for performing calculations. I'm using this project to practice and improve my front-end skills, exploring concepts like responsive design and JavaScript interactivity. Feel free to 
explore, modify, and expand upon this project as you dive into the world of web development!
